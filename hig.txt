We just have to keep pushing through the neutral zone
We're at our best when we play fast
You know, um
The coaches have been telling me to shoot more
It's big boy hockey out there
I've been trying to go top corns more often
I'm happy to be here again up from the minors
I had to go back to get some new lumber
We just have to keep fresh legs on the ice
You know it's all about short shifts
When we play as a team we win
It's a battle out there
We just need to do better on the forecheck
It's all about getting back to protect the house
So
This team has been really coming together
They play a physical game
We need to meet their physicality with our own
We'll keep the pressure on in the next period
So, you know
This is a really great team
All the guys have been so welcoming
It can be hard to be the new guy
I just keep learning every day
I'm going to keep trying my hardest
We're giving it our all
Our coaches expect 110% and we give it to them
We've clicked right from the beginning
We have one more home game before we hit the road again
It's always difficult shaking the cobwebs off after a break
We have spectacular home ice
We always play so well at home
Our fans at home are unbelievable
Yeah
Thanks, uh
I like our puck pressure
We have to make good decisions with the puck
You know and
Ehem

(Wipes sweat from brow)
